(Just have to type "make" into the terminal to build the program.)

	***Sim04 Grading Specs***

For concurrency control, I'm just using threaded timers to time the I/O time and whatever.

I am not using memory management.


PCB and Five State process management system struct in MetaScanner.h as processInfo.

Timing is in scheduler.c as well as my attempt at preemption / interrupts.
	Using the provided timer that Leverington gave us.

FCFS-N, FCFS-P, SJF-N, SJF-P are the only ones that pass the tests for program operation portion of the rubric.

	The preemptive versions get through the whole thing then seg faults at the end. But everything is done at that point so it doesn't really matter. (Input is sometimes a little messy, but I 	
	didn't have enough time to iron it all out.

	Did not implement RR-P, so go ahead and take away the 3 points for that.

	***Extra Notes***

The scheduling works fine when displayed  to monitor, but when written to a file the outputs are correct but they are flipped (ending at top of file, beginning at bottom). Not sure why. The time display for the two operations work as well.


I believe this qualifies as a reasonable attempt, so please don't give me a 0!
I hope I made it a little easier on you to grade!
